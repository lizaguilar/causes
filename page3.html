            <h2>From the food we eat to the energy, transportation, and water we all need, a warmer world will bring big changes for everyone.</h2>
            <p>Global climate change will affect people and the environment in many ways. Some of these impacts, like stronger hurricanes and severe heat waves, could be life threatening. Others, like spreading weeds, will be less serious. And some effects, like longer growing seasons for crops, might even be good! However, as the Earth keeps getting warmer, the negative effects are expected to outweigh the positive ones.</p>
            <p>The more we learn about how climate change will affect people and the environment, the more we can see why people need to take action to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change. We can also take steps to prepare for the changes we know are coming.</p>
            <p>Earth's climate is changing. In the past 50 years, the average temperature in the United States has gone up by 2 degrees F, precipitation has increased by roughly 5 percent, and extreme weather events have become more frequent and intense, according to a recent report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Global warming doesn't just impact nature; your daily life is affected, too.</p>
            <p>Food prices are rising as climate change makes it trickier to maintain the specific conditions crops need to thrive. As the climate warms, the air holds more moisture and rainstorms become more intense, damaging crops. Overall precipitation patterns are also changing, bringing droughts to some areas of the world and floods to others. A recent study published by Stanford University showed that global wheat production decreased by 5.5 percent as a result of an unstable climate, and world corn production was down by nearly 4 percent. So far, North American farmers haven't seen the same drop in productivity, but that is expected to change. (See References 2) The EPA reports that an additional increase of 3.6 degrees F in the global temperature could decrease production of American corn by 10 to 30 percent (see References 3).</p>
            <p>Climate change is often thought of in terms of its effects on our physical environment: melting icecaps, rising sea levels, heat-waves and storms. But increasing evidence shows that the human impact – and in particular the impact on human health – will be a major challenge for scientists, politicians and ordinary people in years to come.</p>
            <p>The precise extent of the impact is difficult to quantify exactly because there are so many different factors at play. But one thing is certain: climate change is having an effect, and as the planet warms up, that effect is only going to increase.</p>
